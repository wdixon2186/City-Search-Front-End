An app that allows potential movers to find relevant data about the top 50 cities in the United States.

# HOW IT WORKS

The app opens on a list of US News' top 50 cities, allowing the user to scroll through the options, or if they have a place in mind, the user can use a search bar at the top.

Once the user finds a city they want more information on, the user can click on the name of the city to access an information page.

In the information page the user is given a list of Accordion buttons that are labeled with broad data topics. If the user wants to learn more information on the topic they can click on the button to expand the accordion and see the data.

There is also a place for the user to leave a review, as well as an option for the user to edit a previous review, located in an accordion button at the bottom of the page.

If the user ever wants to return to the original list, all they have to do is click on the,'City Fyndr' icon located at the top of the page.

Likewise, if the user wanted to know more about the page or the people who buil it, they could click on the about button or any of the names at the bottom of the page.

# INSTILLATION

The site can be accessed [here](https://wdixon2186.github.io/City-Search-Front-End/#/)

Otherwise the user can clone down this repository, making sure they have the react app titled city-search. From there they could make changes, or look at our code, by accessing the src folder.

# THOUGHT PROCESS

- On React.
  We approached React with a divide and conquer mentality.
  The entire project began with the front end and back end sitting down and creating wire-frames for what we wanted the site to look like, and what functionality it would have.

  From there, we defined each component that would be needed, and then built them out in their own category.

  We then confirmed with the back-end on the format of the data, and the routes they were building, then implemented sample data and routes so we could build out both ends at the same time.

  Once the backend was deployed, we installed axios to access it, and removed our sample data.

* On Express.

# UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS

If given more time, we would set up the reviews function on our city pages to post the reviews without the need to reload the page.
