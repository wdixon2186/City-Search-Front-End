## INSTALLATION

City Fyndr can be accessed in any browser <a href="https://wdixon2186.github.io/City-Search-Front-End/#/" target="_blank">here</a>.
You may also choose to copy this code and make edits of your own. To do so, follow the steps in <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo" target="_blank">this article</a>.
  
Additionally, you will need to install all this app's dependencies by running `npm install` from the `city-search` folder.

Once these are each successfully installed, you may then access the app through your localhost by running `npm start` in your terminal.  

## THOUGHT PROCESS

### User Story

### Front-End (ReactJS)

  We approached React with a divide and conquer mentality.
  The entire project began with the front end and back end sitting down and creating wireframes for what we wanted the site to look like, and what functionality it would have.

  From there, we defined each component that would be needed, and then built them out in their own category.

  We then confirmed with the back-end on the format of the data, and the routes they were building, then implemented sample data and routes so we could build out both ends at the same time.

  Once the backend was deployed, we installed axios to access it, and removed our sample data.

### Back-End (Express and MongoDB)

  For the back-end, we first exported Census data for the top 50 cities ranked by U.S. News' and built an API. Next, we set up all necessary routes for full CRUD functionality (included in picture below).

  * Adjust each data point to have a helpful title as opposed to the current camel case titles
